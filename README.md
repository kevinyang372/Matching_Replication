Replication of Gary King's paper written in 2005 - The Supreme Court during crisis: How war affects only non-war cases

## Proposal

In the paper, the authors used a variety of matching methods including logistic regression, exact matching except for term, exact matching, propensity score matching, and propensity score matching with logistic adjustment.  These approaches are summarized in Table 7. The code provided is not working as it was written in 2009 but seems to have the proper structure which we will fix. We will reproduce Table 7 and also extend it using Genetic Matching.
